1. Introduction 
This is a template, you don’t need to fill up every section. Please use it as a reference, and customize it as what you need.  
 
1.1 Purpose  
This section should  
a) Delineate the purpose of the SRS;  
b) Specify the intended audience for the SRS.  
 
1.2 Scope  
This section should  
a) Identify the software product(s) to be produced by name;  
b) Explain what the software product(s) will, and, if necessary, will not do;  
c) Describe the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals;  
d) Be consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., the system requirements specification), if they exist.  
 
1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations  
This section should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS. This information may be provided by reference to one or more appendixes in the SRS or by reference to other documents.  
 
1.4 References  
This section should  
a) Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS;  
b) Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization;  
c) Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.  
This information may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.  
 
1.5 Overview  
This section should  
a) Describe what the rest of the SRS contains;  
b) Explain how the SRS is organized.  

2. Overall Description 
 
This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3 of the SRS, and makes them easier to understand.  
 
2.1 Product Perspective  
This section should put the product into perspective with other related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software. 
 
2.2 Product Functions  
This section should provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform. The functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.  
 
Use case diagram can be used to show the different functions and their relationships.  
 
3. Specific requirements  
 
This section of the SRS should contain all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.  
 
3.1 Functional requirements  
This section is important since it lists all functional requirements.  
 
This section should list the functional requirements with details. Please organize the functional requirements into sub-sections with textual description for each requirement.  
 
3.2 Non-functional requirements  
This section should list the non-functional requirements with details. Please organize the non-functional requirements into sub-sections. All of these requirements should be stated in measurable terms.  
 
3.2.1 Performance Requirements  
This subsection should specify both the static and the dynamic numerical requirements placed on the software or on human interaction with the software as a whole. Static numerical requirements may include the following:  
a) The number of terminals to be supported;  
b) The number of simultaneous users to be supported;  
c) Amount and type of information to be handled.  
Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for example, the numbers of transactions and tasks and the amount of data to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions.  
All of these requirements should be stated in measurable terms.  
For example,  
95% of the transactions shall be processed in less than 1 s.  
rather than,  
An operator shall not have to wait for the transaction to complete.  
 
3.2.2 Other non-functional requirements which are necessary to your system  
…… 
 
3.3 Logical database requirements  
This should specify the logical requirements for any information that is to be placed into a database. This may include the following:  
a) Types of information used by various functions;  
b) Frequency of use;  
c) Accessing capabilities;  
d) Data entities and their relationships;  
e) Integrity constraints;  
f) Data retention requirements.
